# CNN Convolution & Pooling Demo

This project demonstrates the basic concepts of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), focusing on convolution and pooling operations. It provides simple code examples and visualizations to help understand how these layers work in deep learning.

## Features

- Step-by-step explanation of convolution and pooling
- Example code using Python and NumPy
- Visualizations of input, filters, and outputs

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualizations, optional)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AnisHerdev/CNN_conv_pooling_demo.git
    cd CNN_conv_pooling_demo
    ```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the main demo script:
    ```bash
    python max_pooling.py
    ```

2. Follow the on-screen instructions and view the visualizations.
